# Semantic
Solution for Compulsory Task 1 for SE T38.

## Description
In this program, we are just playing around with spaCy to understand its workings. We use semantic similarity models to compare words with words and then sentences with sentences.

This task was completed during the Department for Education (DfE) sponsored Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev (Nov 2022 cohort).

It demonstrates the implementation of natural language processing.
